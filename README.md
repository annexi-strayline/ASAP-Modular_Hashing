# ASAP-Modular_Hashing
ANNEXI-STRAYLINE AURA Public (ASAP) Repository - Modular hashing subsystem

This subsystem is a member of the larger [ASAP Repository](https://github.com/annexi-strayline/ASAP)

This subsystem provides a modular hashing framework that allows for a uniform application and interchangeability of any number of hash algorithms.

Currently, a number of common cryptographic and high-performance hashes are included.

Eventually, platform-optimized algorithms may be added.
